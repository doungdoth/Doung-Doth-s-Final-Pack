# Grade expected


*The grade that I think I deserve is a at least a B or about an 80% of the total.


*Justification: It is because I have attended all class meetings, with no absent days. I have stayed the duration of the class period to ensure that I am not missing important matter. 

* The whole course required time in class as well as time outside, and believe I have done that.

*I tried my best to participate and contribute to the class assignments whether that is discussions held online and or work that needs to be completed on a timely matter.

* I understand that there were a some assignments that I unfortunately missed, as well as some that were turned it late, and understand that may affect my grade. 

* The teacher has the right to give what he believes students deserves.
