Since then, the Android operating system has been going head to head with its competitors and has already released thirty-nine editions and updates. 
Since the IT revolution began, many operating systems have developed and used Android for different types of devices including computers and phones. When it comes to phones, there have been all kinds of mobile operating systems, ranging from the most simple and basic ones to the most sophisticated modern operating systems designed for the powerful smartphones available today.







# Early History

It was the Palm OS as one of the earliest mobile OS’, which was launched in 1996, then the   Windows Pocket PC released in 2000, followed by Blackberry OS and then the revolutionary Android platform. Android has emerged as the most widely used mobile OS in current use. What makes it unique is that it is much more than just an operating system. It also includes applications and middleware. This essay explores the history of the Android OS.
Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California in the year 2003. Behind it was a smart and intellectual group. The   names included Rich Miner and Chris White Andy Rubin, Nick Sears. I was then, Android Inc. was bought by Google. Google acquired the Android Inc in 2005, which resulted in an unexpectant growth of the operating system. Interesting enough, the idea was created not for what it is used today, but for the use of digital cameras with sophisticated OS for. I t was later then that google had redirected its ideas to mobile phone operating system. Windows Mobile and Symbian were its primary competitors.
Google purchased Android in 2005 and unveiled it to the public in 2007. It founded the Open Handset Alliance, a group of companies that promoted open standards within the   mobile device domain. Then the first advertisement commercial Android device was launched in September of 2008. Since then the mobile OS has seen various versions to reach the current 7.0 Nougat, which initiated in August of 2016.
Android OS over the years, has released its various versions and updates, for consumers. The following is a timeline to the Android Operating System version from beginning to latest: 


# First Ever
* Android v1.0

The very first Android was released in 2008. It was created to handle effectively with notifications. It is with the pull-down notification window that made it a revolutionary addition. The current Google Play Store first introduced in version 1.0 as Android Market. It also allowed widgets to be used on the home screen. A feature that the iOS platform has not yet been able to include.

* Android 1.5 Cupcake

This version of Android launched in 2009. It is the first Android version to have an on screen keyboard. This also allowed third-party developers to create and add widgets by opening the widgets SDK. Android Cupcake also allowed video captured for the first time on the platform.

It could be supported by different screen sizes, allowing manufacturers to use Android on various and different sizes of devices. The Version 1.6 also introduced the search box and redesigned the standard Android Market.

The version 2.0 was also launched in 2009 and introduced many significant changes. In was now that it was the first mobile OS to come with Google Maps Navigation. That meant navigation with a voice guidance and turn-by-turn navigation system. These are some of the features introduced in Maps in Android 2.0 that continue to be in use still today. Google were generous enough to provide these features for free without no cost, as compared to paid offerings from the competition. HTML5 was the internet browser supported in version Android Eclair.

* Android 2.2 Froyo
 
Android version 2.2 released in 2010 on the Nexus One device. This version fine-tuned the already good Android experience. It welcomed five home screen panels introduced in place of earlier 3 home screens. This version also added the mobile hotspot support and PIN lock screen features.

* Android 2.3 Gingerbread

Surprisingly Gingerbread was also introduced the same year as Froyo. The home screen and stock widgets redesigned, and the overall OS experience further refined. The version featured a better keyboard having new key colors and better multi-touch support. Android OS also began supporting the front-facing camera.
Android 3.0 Honeycomb
Version 3.0 released in 2011, and it was designed keeping in mind other users including those of tablet users. Many of the   designs from Honeycomb have been kept in the current versions too. Android began showing examples for each widget, which was a major concern with users in the earlier versions. One of the biggest changes in Honeycomb which was that the virtual buttons replaced the physical button. Home, menu and back buttons became part of the software. Google also switched Android’s highlights color from green to blue.

* Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich

The Ice Cream Sandwich continued and carried along a lot of the features of Honeycomb. The legacy of the   virtual buttons brought forward, and the   interface became even more refined. Google released many other new small features in the updated including face unlock, calendar and mail apps, and data usage details.

* Android 4.1 Jelly Bean

Android Jelly Bean was released in 2012. The visual features were kept the same as from its predecessor, but included minute yet important underlying changes. Google Now was introduced, and users could open it with a quick swipe. That included emails, calendar events, and weather reports brought on the   same screen.  It was also the   first time when Google laid the   foundations for its future digital assistants. Project Butter significantly improved the mobile OS’ touch performance. It involved developing the   buffering graphics of headsets. Some other changes or improvements were that Android included better font, more configuration room for the widget, and notifications. 


* Android 4.4 KitKat

Android version 4.4 was released in 2013 and introduced many big improvements and features. It was accounted for a major aesthetic update to the mobile OS. The blue colored highlights in the Ice Cream Sandwich and Jellybean resulted in a more modern and refined white highlight. The change was switched to lighter color scheme across many elements. Other new additions included the voice command ok google. A command to launch Google Now, with an improved phone dialer, and including apps like the Hangouts. 

* Android 5.0 Lollipop

Google released Android Lollipop in 2014. It was created around Google’s popular Material Design concept. The major updates included Android Runtime replacing Dalvik VM, improved notifications, support for RAW image format, and improved refinement. Google also introduced an entirely new version of the already applications mobile OS, Android TV.

* Android 6.0 Marshmallow

Android Marshmallow launched in 2015. Android v6.0, Google even brought complete changes to the   app menu. They included a search bar that was added to search apps quickly, and the background switched colored, from white to black. It also added memory manager, more elaborate volume controls, and advanced features including supporting fingerprint sensors.


* Android 7.0 Nougat

Android version 7.0 released in August of 2016. Google Now was replaced by the Google Assistant. The notifications system received a great changes and updates as with loose grouping together and screen to screen viewing. This version of Nougat also improved multi-tasking. The split-screen mode allows using two apps simultaneously. 






Android operating system can be considered one that has not been around that long as compared to some other operating systems, but it has come a long way. It is with the different advancement and changes to owners, and people wanting different features. That google listened to them and has delivered all these different versions first coming out since 2008 and still counting. Who knows what will the future hold for Android operating systems. My hypothesis is that it is only the start for Android Operating Systems, and will only continue to grow, just as the humans continue to expand and push the boundaries with technology.
