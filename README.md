# Attendance

 * I have not been absent, and have been to each and every class meeting beginning from week 1 8/25/17, all through to the final week 12/13/17. 


* The purpose of attending every class meeting is what I believe is because due to it being only a single class a week, for four hours, there is much to learn, and very little time per class meeting. 

* I make it a a personal goal to attend each class, because I understand what is being held in class is important, whether it is regarding notes, demos, lectures,peers, assignments or just answers to potential questions, I did my best to attend each class meeting, and for the duration of the class session.
